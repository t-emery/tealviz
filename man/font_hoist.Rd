}
\arguments{
\item{family_name}{name of the font family.}

\value{
The function returns a message indicating whether the font
was successfully loaded or not.
}
\description{
Sometimes, even when fonts are loaded on a computer, they are not
immediately available for use in R. This function fixes that.
}
\details{
See \href{https://yjunechoe.github.io/posts/2021-06-24-setting-up-and-debugging-custom-fonts/}{June Choe's blog post explaining this}.
This function requires the user to have already downloaded the
font on their computer, and to have set up \code{ragg} as described
in the blog post.

\examples{
