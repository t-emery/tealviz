\item{title_font}{The default title is "Roboto". To swich to the matching
Serif font picked out in the design phase (Lora), use \code{title_font = "fancy"}.

removed but the axis text is retained.}

\item{base_text_size}{Base text size in pt. The relative size of the title /
subtitle text and of the margins is derived from this.}
