`tealviz` is a collection of data visualization tools for [Teal Emery](https://www.tealemery.com/) + [Teal Insights](https://www.linkedin.com/company/teal-insights/?viewAsMember=true). The package is publicly available on GitHub with a permissive (MIT) license to facilitate the reproducibility of Teal Emery + Teal Insights analysis. I kindly ask that you don't use it for your own work, however you are welcome to use the code as a building block to create your own data viz package.

This package builds upon a package that [Cara Thompson](https://www.cararthompson.com/) helped me build. I'm a researcher, not an artist, so having such a skilled designer help me build this package was a huge help. I highly recommend her work. The inspired coding & visual design work are hers. The mistakes are mine.

## Prerequisites

To install on Ubuntu, you may first need to install `libmagick++-dev` on your system by running the following commands in your terminal:

``` bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install libmagick++-dev
```

## Installation

You can install the development version of tealviz from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
devtools::install_github("t-emery/tealviz")
```

### Fonts

When you load the `tealviz` package with `library(tealviz)`, you will be prompted to install the required fonts (`Roboto`, `Roboto Condensed`, `Lora`, and `Lora Bold`) automatically. Simply type `y` and press enter to install them. (In CI workflows, this is done automatically.)

If you'd prefer to install the fonts manually, you can get them from [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/). They are also available as assets in the `tealviz` package. You can find them in the [`inst/assets/fonts`](https://github.com/t-emery/tealviz/tree/main/inst/assets/fonts) folder of the GitHub repo. Place them in your system's `fonts` directory. (The folder's exact location will vary by operating system.)

On Windows, custom system fonts may be unavailable to the default RMarkdown rendering engine. If you're having trouble, try installing the `ragg` package with `install.packages("ragg")` and then setting `dev = "ragg_png"` in your RMarkdown chunk options. Just add `knitr::opts_chunk$set(dev = "ragg_png")` to the top of your RMarkdown file. You can also set the option globally in RStudio by going to `Tools` > `Global Options` > `General` > `Graphics` and setting the `Backend` field to `AGG`.

## Example

The core of the `tealviz` package is a series of `ggplot2` custom themes, and custom colors/palettes. 

``` {r example}
library(tealviz)
# On loading the package, it automatically makes sure the fonts are available
# for use. You may see messages in the console about fonts being installed.
library(ggplot2)

palmerpenguins::penguins |>
  dplyr::filter(
    !is.na(bill_length_mm),
    !is.na(flipper_length_mm),
    !is.na(body_mass_g)
  ) |>
  ggplot() +
  geom_point(
    aes(
      x = bill_length_mm,
      y = flipper_length_mm,
      size = body_mass_g,
      fill = body_mass_g
    ),
    shape = 21,
    color = ti_colors$background
  ) +
  labs(
    title = "Perfectly proportional penguins",
    subtitle = paste0(
      "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do ",
      "eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua. Ut enim ",
      "ad minim veniam, quis nostrud exercitation ullamco laboris nisi ut ",
      "aliquip ex ea commodo consequat."
    ),
    x = "Bill length (mm)",
    y = "Flipper length (mm)",
    fill = "Body mass (g)",
    caption = "Demo plot, built with {palmerpenguins}"
  ) +
  guides(size = "none") +
  scale_fill_ti(continuous = TRUE) +
  theme_ti()
```

The Title and Subtitle use [`ggtext`](https://wilkelab.org/ggtext/articles/introduction.html) under the hood. This adds powerful functionality, to be explored in its own vignette. For now, know that it will auto-wrap the subtitle so you can provide commentary about the visualizations key takeaways without worrying about line breaks.
